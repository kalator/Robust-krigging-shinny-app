<h2>Variogram</h2>
<p style="word-wrap: break-word; width: 80ch; text-align: justify"> 
The geostatistical interpolation is based on characteristics of spatial random field. Variogram is a function describing these characteristics. Let <i>z(x)</i> be the observed value at point <i>x</i>. Variogram shows how the value of <i>z</i> will alter with a shift of distance <i>h</i>. The equation for so called <b>experimental variogram</b>:
$$\gamma(h) = \frac{1}{2n}\sum_i[z(x_i)-z(x_i+h)]^2$$
where <i>&gamma;(h)</i> is a semivariance of <i>z</i> for distance of <i>h</i>.

The experimental variogram is composed of isolated discrete points, therefore it is necessary to have it aproximated by so called <b>theoretical variogram</b>. The theoretical variogram could be described with exact mathematical formula. A model of theoretical variogram is choosen accordingly to the characteristics of the experimental variogram. The most common method used for this process is called "by-eye" (what fits the greatest). Basic types of models are exponential, spherical and Gaussian model.

In example above, it is apparent that the best fitting model of theoretical variogram is the exponential one. The mathematical equations for basic model types:
<ul>
<li>
<p style="word-wrap: break-word; width: 74ch; text-align: justify"> 
<b>Exponential</b> model is used for lineary dependent data:
$$\gamma(h) = C(1-e^{-ha})$$
</li>
<\p>
<li>
<p style="word-wrap: break-word; width: 74ch; text-align: justify"> 
<b>Spherical</b> model is used for lineary dependent data with greater dependence of closer values:
\begin{align}
h \leq a: \ \gamma(h) &= C(\frac{3h}{2a}-\frac{h^3}{2a^3})\\
h \geq a: \ \gamma(h) &= C 
\end{align}
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p style="word-wrap: break-word; width: 74ch; text-align: justify"> 
<b>Gaussian</b> model has similar character as exponential but the begining has parabolic course representing a slow decrease of spatial dependence:
$$\gamma(h) = C(1-e^{-\frac{h^2}{a^2}})$$
</p>
</li>
</ul>
where <i>C</i> and <i>a</i> are two of three basic parameters of variogram: <br> <br>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Sill</b> (<i>C</i>) - value of variogram from which there are no changes in following values
</li>
<li>
<b>Range</b> (<i>a</i>) - distance where variogram reaches its maximum (sill)
</li>
<li>
<b>Nugget</b> - shift of variogram in its begining.
</li>
</ul>
