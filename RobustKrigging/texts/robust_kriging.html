There is a formula for calculating estimate predicted value. The formula uses values 
of nearby points and their weights.

Robust statistic very often uses lognormal kriging. It is a kind of kriging, which 
is logarithmicly transformed to testing data. At first the data are trasformed to 
natural logarithm, eventually into decadic logarithm. The result is in the end 
reversed. It is necessary to fix it by systematic errors.

The technique of lognormal kriging is very often used because of it decreasing 
scatter of testing data. The result is still partly distorted, because the data 
is dependent on semivariogram.
