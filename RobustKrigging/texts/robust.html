It was first mentioned in 1961. Robustness is capacity of being inert to 
small but deliberate changes to the method parameters. It provides information 
about on its reliability during normal use. In general, it is insensitive to small 
deviations from ideal assuptions for which the estimation method is optimized.

The classic example of robust method is median. It is a special case of percentile. 
The values are sorted by size and the one in the middle is median. One of big 
advantage of median is its robustness, because it is not affected by remote values.

The first estimate of robust variogram was in 1980 by Cressie and Hawkins. They devised two types of variograms.

<p style="word-wrap: break-word; width: 80ch; text-align: justify"> 
Variogram in basic form:
$$\gamma(h) = \frac{(\frac{1}{N(h)}\sum (z(x_i)-z(x_i+h)^{\frac{1}{2}}))^4}{2(0.457+\frac{0.494}{N(h)})}$$

Variogram based on the count of median:
$$\gamma(h) = \frac{med(z(x_i)-z(x_i+h)^{\frac{1}{2}} \ : \ h \in N(h))^4}{2\cdot 0.457}$$
