<p style="word-wrap: break-word; width: 80ch; text-align: justify"> 
Geostatistics is concerned with the estimation and prediction problems for stochastic phenomena on the Earth, it refers to the application of general statistical principles of modeling and inference to geostatistical problems. Originally it was developed for predictions of ore deposits. Nowadays it is used in many fields of science such as meteorology, hydrology, pedology etc. One of the most famous methods of geostatistics is kriging, which is the main subject of this web application. Kriging is a method of interpolation that uses geostationary methods of estimate.

<h3>About this app</h3>
<p style="word-wrap: break-word; width: 80ch; text-align: justify"> 
Purpose of this web application is to comprehensibly present the basics of kriging. The application is written in R using Shiny package. Shiny is an open source package that provides web framework for building web applications using R. There are few interactive widgets alowing user to make some computation himself. Computations are processed with R packages geoR and georob with data that are provided natively by these packages.
