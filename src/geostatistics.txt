Geostatistics is a branch of statistics dealing with estimates and predictions of stochastic phenomena on Earth. Originally it was developped for predictions of ore deposits. Nowadays it is used in many fileds of science, such as meteorology, hydrology, pedology etc. The most important part of geostatistics are interpolation methods. One of them is krigging. It is one of the technique for interpolation random field. Krigging use Gauss proces acording to apriori covariance. We can say that krigging gives the best linear prediction of mean value. There are many methods of krigging. They are described in more detail in examples.
