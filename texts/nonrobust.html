Geostatistic interpolation is based on character of spatial value. This character 
can be described by variograms. The basic variogram is called experimental.

The experimental variogram is made of isolated points, it is necessary to 
aproximate it by the theoretical variogram. Model of theoretical variogram is 
choosen by eye according to experimental variogram. The most important models 
are exponential, spheric and gauss.

There are formulas of each variogram. Constant C means sill. Sill is value 
from which the others dont change. Constant a means range, it is distance where 
the function gets its maximum. &gamma; (h) is semivariance of variable z for 
distance h.

Gauss model has similar character as exponential but the begining has parabolic 
course.
