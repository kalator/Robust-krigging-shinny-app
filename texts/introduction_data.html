There are real data which are used for calculating variograms and kriging. They are 
included in packages by R Project. 
</p>

<p style="word-wrap: break-word; width: 80ch; text-align: justify"> 
There is dataset s100 in package geoR which was used for calculating non-robust 
variograms. This dataset contains coordinates and values for each point. 
</p>

<p style="word-wrap: break-word; width: 80ch; text-align: justify"> 
For robust calculating was used package georob. For presenting robust method there 
was used dataset meuse. This dataset contains coordinates and values of metal 
in soil. There is for example amount of zinc, cadmium, lead or copper. It also 
contains distance from the river.

It is necessary to use spatial data to generate and display the result of kriging. 
Both dataset fulfill this condition.
